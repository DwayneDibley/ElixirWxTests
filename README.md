# ElixirWxTests

_Tests for the ElixirWx package._

The tests can be invoked directly in iex using:

```
  iex -S mix
```

or compiled and run as an escript:

```
mix esctript.build
./wx_tests
```

On start, the main test window is shown. The various tests are chosen from this
windows menu. Note that on MacOs the menu is at the top of the main window!
